This repository contains the implementation of the StringProcessor class in Java, which provides several string processing functionalities, along with comprehensive test cases for each method. The assignment adheres to Object-Oriented Programming principles and includes exception handling for edge cases.
The StringProcessor class provides the following methods:

1. boolean isStrongPassword(String password)
Checks if the provided password is strong. A strong password must contain:
At least one uppercase letter
At least one lowercase letter
At least one digit
At least one special character
Returns true if the password meets the above criteria, otherwise returns false.

2. int calculateDigits(String sentence)
Counts the number of digits in the given sentence.
Returns the total count of digits.

3. int calculateWords(String sentence)
Calculates the number of words in the given sentence, where words are considered separated by spaces.
Returns the total count of words.

4. double calculateExpression(String expression)
Evaluates a well-formed mathematical expression (including numbers, arithmetic operations, and brackets).
Returns the result of the expression.
